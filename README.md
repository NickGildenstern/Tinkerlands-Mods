## 🚀 How to Install Mods

We made installing mods as easy as possible.  
You just need to download the mod `.zip` file from **⬇️mods** and place (the same `.zip` file — you **don’t** need to extract it) into the `mods` folder located in the same directory as your `tinkerlands.exe`.

> 💡 You can easily find this folder by right-clicking **Tinkerlands** in your Steam library, then selecting  
> `Manage` → `Browse Local Files`.

3. **Open the Mod in Tinker Tool**
